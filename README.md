# Dog_Classification
This Google Colab Notebook was created to determine the breed of a dog in an image.

Below is a picture of my dog, Sherman. He is a Staffordshire Terrier that loves Starbucks. 

I used deep learning/transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the backbone of my machine learning model which was then
trained on an additional 10,000+ dog images with labels. 
After that, I tested it on Sherman, and it worked!
